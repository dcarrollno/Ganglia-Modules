This Ganglia module is one example of how we monitor JMX metrics across
a large variety of systems. The bulks of this is borrowed from the project
https://code.google.com/archive/p/jmxsh/ but has been adapted and modified 
to suit the needs of my team. 

The files included are left in .erb format as it is part of
a Puppet template.  If you want to use this you will need to edit those
tags out or adapt them to your own. 

You will also need the jmx.jar file available at the project site noted
above. 

I decided to group the metrics I am interested in and thread these to 
improve performance and segment the metrics I am collecting to protect
against full metric failure when someone changes a bean.  I typically
therefore have a java.lang group that collects memory, heap, threads 
info etc.. and a metric group that collects specific app metrics in a 
separate thread.
