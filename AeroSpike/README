Aerospike

python module for Ganglia 3.1

This python module calls the native asinfo utility within Aerospike
and parses metric results based upon whatever you add.  I created this
as I was unable to find anything similar online for Aerospike and
while we use the Aerospike dashboard, we also like to trend specific 
items alongside our system metrics within Ganglia. 

This can no doubt be improved so feel free to do so.
