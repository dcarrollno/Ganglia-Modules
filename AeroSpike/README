Aerospike

python module for Ganglia 3.1

This python module calls the native asinfo utility within Aerospike
and parses metric results based upon whatever you add.  I created this
as I was unable to find anything similar online for Aerospike and
while we use the Aerospike dashboard, we also like to trend specific 
items alongside our system metrics within Ganglia. 

I use this in a Puppet template to define whether or not to 
trend metrics involving XDR on clusters where we support that.

This can no doubt be improved so feel free to do so.
