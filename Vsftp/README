Vsftpd

python module for Ganglia 3.1

This simple python module gathers vsftpd stats from the vsftpd logfile.
We run this during the day to collect on-going stats and trend our 
vsftpd usage by customers. We track logins, failures, uploads and downloads.

Each day when the logfile rotates, so do the stats in our metrics.
