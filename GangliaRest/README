This module is incomplete as is, because it is part of 
a package of dozens of tools I have built around Ganglia and
I am unable to include some dependency classes. But, this example
should provide enough in the way to tips or hints for others to 
build upon or make better. 

You can find an explanation here:
https://github.com/dcarrollno/Ganglia-Modules/wiki/Ganglia-API:-Nagios-Polling

To use this you will need to disable my loglib calls or create/use 
your own logging library and you will need a class that 
polls metric values from RRD files and returns those. This is 
explained in the above link. Apologies for not providing a 
complete solution but part of the fun is adapting these things
for your own use.  

Have fun!
