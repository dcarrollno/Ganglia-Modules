This module is incomplete as is, because it is part of 
a package of dozens of tools I have built around Ganglia.

You can find an explanation here:
https://github.com/dcarrollno/Ganglia-Modules/wiki/Ganglia-API:-Nagios-Polling

To use this you will need to disable my loglib calls or create/use 
your own logging library and you will need a class that 
polls metric values from RRD files and returns those. This is 
explained in the above link. Apologies for not providing a 
complete solution but part of the fun is adapting these things
for your own use.  

Have fun!
