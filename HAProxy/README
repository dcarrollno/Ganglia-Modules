HAProxy Ganglia Metric Module

python module for Ganglia 3.1 running under CentOS 6.x or CentOS 7.x

This python module calls each of the HAProxy stats sockets and collects a
defined list of interesting metrics. We then prefer to sum those metrics up
and display them in Ganglia rather than viewing 8 or more HAProxy stats pages. 

This module threads out the collector to allow smoother operations for gmond
and avoids impact to other modules.

You must yum install socat onto your HAProxy system. 

There are a few edits to configure this for your own use. First, in the pyconf define
the farms or clusters of servers you have running, in a list format like so:
param clusters {
    value = "webservers-nodes, appserver-nodes"
}

You then define the cluster members for each like so:
param webserver-nodes {
    value = "web1, web2, web3"
}
param appserver-node {
    value = "app1, app2, app3"
}

You can define metrics you want to collect like:
param interestingItems {
    value = "scur,bin,bout,dreq,ereq,econ,eresp,chkfail,rate,"
}


Then, on the actual haproxy.py module you can define the same (see examples) 
under __name__=='__main__' for testing and debugging.

This can no doubt be improved so feel free to do so.
