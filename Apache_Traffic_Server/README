Apache Traffic Server

python module for Ganglia 3.1

This python module calls the Apache Traffic Server stats module web page 
and parses metric results based upon definitions in your pyconf.  I created this
as I was unable to find anything similar online. 

To use this you must enable the stats module within ATS. Directions can be found
here: https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/4.2.x/reference/plugins/stats_over_http.en.html

To use this module, edit the URL to call in the ats.py module. Drop this module into
your python modules dir and restart gmond. 

This can no doubt be improved so feel free to do so.
